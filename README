This repo contains most of my practice material for programming competitions. Right now it's empty but it will probably include:

Various algorithm implementations (discrete, geometrical, graph, string search, etc).
Useful (and brief) implementations of Java and C++ libraries.
Files written under a timer.

This repo will NOT have any solutions for past problems. Past problems do get reused in practice rounds and this is to disuade anyone from using my repo to cheat in practice rounds.
