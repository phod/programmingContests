Rod Cutting Problem
-------------------

We have a rod of size n. We can sell different sizes of the rod
for different prices. We want to find out the most money we
can make from our rod of size n, by possibly cutting it into
smaller rods.

Input
-----

On the first line, the program expects a single integer which is
the size of the input rod.
On the follow n lines, there is a single integer giving the
value of the rod of size i, where i is the line number.

Example
-------

4
1
3
3
5

We have a rod of size 4, followed by the values: 1 for length 1,
3 for length 2, 3 for length 3, and 5 for length 4.

Output
------

A single integer, the max value we can get by cutting the rods.
